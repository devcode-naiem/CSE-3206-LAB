## ðŸ“– **What We Learned**
In today's lab session, we expanded our knowledge of Git and GitHub with a focus on remote repository management and branching. Here's what we covered:

1. **Controlling Remote Repositories**:  
   - Pushing changes from the local machine to a remote repository.  
   - Pulling updates from a remote repository to a local machine.  

2. **Branching**:  
   - Creating branches locally and pushing them to a remote repository.  
   - Creating branches directly on a remote repository and pulling them to a local machine.
